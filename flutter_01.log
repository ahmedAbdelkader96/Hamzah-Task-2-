FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Directory '/Users/ahmed/Desktop/Hamzah-Task-3-Secure-Authentication-and-User-Management-/android' does not contain a Gradle build.

A Gradle build should contain a 'settings.gradle' or 'settings.gradle.kts' file in its root directory. It may also contain a 'build.gradle' or 'build.gradle.kts' file.

To create a new Gradle build in this directory run 'gradlew init'

For more detail on the 'init' task see https://docs.gradle.org/7.6.3/userguide/build_init_plugin.html

For more detail on creating a Gradle build see https://docs.gradle.org/7.6.3/userguide/tutorial_using_tasks.html

* Try:
> Run gradlew init to create a new Gradle build in this directory.
> Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
> Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

* Get more help at https://help.gradle.org
